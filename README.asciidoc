Introductions

== 00:01:00
Give them the URL to download the slides. Encourage them to do so. footnote::[I could put these notes online, too]

== 00:01:30
Describe the Android hardware options:

USB/Open Accessory/ADK:: The microcontroller, such as an Arduino, plays host to—and powers—the phone. Most widely supported. USB Host is not widely available, but opens up a whole lot of possibilities (and shouldn't require the device to power the phone). footnote::[add ADK to the slide and also explain the distinctions between USB, Open Accessory, ADK]
NFC/RFID:: Can read and write MiFare RFID tags. 1k, 4k, 16k storage is common. I've got a bunch of tags. You can each have one or two. Can also exchange messages between devices, and can emulate a tag.
Bluetooth:: Possibly the most flexible way to talk from something like Arduino to an Android phone (unlike the ADK, it's untethered). Very easy, too—it's just a serial connection. That's outside the scope of this presentation, but come see us in the Make booth for more info.
Blinkenlights:: serial over light. footnote::[This is using that property of LEDs that Mims discovered, right?]
IOIO board:: from SparkFun Electronics and Ytai Ben-Tsvi. Similar to (and predates) USB and Open Accessory.

We'll demo each of these in a moment.

What we'll teach you in this session:

The basics of Android development:: real quick hello world type intro because a few of you footnote::[double check spreadsheet] don't have Android dev experience.
The basics of Arduino development:: A lot of you haven't done this before, and we'll take this a little slower footnote::[be sure you do!]
Making Stuff with the ADK:: How to bridge the world of Arduino and Android. Sense and manipulate the physical world with your phone.

== 00:04:30
What you'll need to know: the usual. elementary programming skills for Arduino, more hardcore OO programming for Android.

== 00:05:00
On to the demos. We'll get into the code later.

What we'll do with the ADK. Two key things:

Control the Arduino with the Android phone:: turn on an LED footnote::[is this right?]. Same principle applies to motor and many other actuators.
Make the phone respond to the real world:: Android phones have a lot of sensors. Arduino can connect them to a lot more.

== 00:07:00
Demo video: show off Tyler's project. Walk through the key bits:

* Android app
* Arduino connections
* Sensors and actuators
* Power supply making it work well

== 00:10:00
What we'll demonstrate with NFC:

* Write something to a tag
* Read something from a tag
* Also mention:
** Sending data between two phones
** Emulating a tag

== 00:11:30
Demo video: show off NFC/RFID bits. Explain what happens at each point:

* Writing data to a tag
* Reading data from a tag
* Different types of tags

== 00:13:00
Overview of the other options:

* Bluetooth control
* IOIO

== 00:14:30
Demo video: show off robot. Explain the following:

* Pairing
* Selection of device
* Connection/disconnection
* Explain the Arduino Pro Mini
* How Arduino talks to the motors
* How Arduino talks to Bluetooth
* Where to buy the Bluetooth module
* What you do in Bluetooth handler, how you update the robot's speed

== 00:17:00
Demo video: programming the Wayne and Layne LED grid. What just happened?

* PIC microcontroller has a mode in which you can load strings over the LEDs
* LEDs are light sensors as well as emitters
* It's basically a serial protocol (clock+data)

== 00:21:00
Overview of what you need to do some of this stuff footnote::[give this slide a better title].

* Android 2.3.4 or later for ADK
* Nexus S for NFC footnote::[what about the new nexus?]
* Arduino Mega ADK
* Arduino Uno or similar
* All kinds of sensors and actuators. An LED and a pushbutton are a good start.
* RFID module for Arduino

== 00:28:00
Overview of the five projects in this session:

* The hello, world of Arduino: blinking an LED
* The basic Android Hello, World. If you know this stuff, feel free to take a break. 
* Communicating from Arduino to Android and vice-versa
* Reading and writing an RFID tag from Android
* Creating a tag reader with Arduino and Processing (Processing is running on a computer)
